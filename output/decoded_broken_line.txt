 64-digit values fši¦š€I 07]±§Ú±ú¬v§±¹Êëuú¬~¨±úšons. The general strategy is to choose 64 characters that are common to most encodings and that are also printable. This combination leaves the data unlikely to be modified in transit through information systems, such as email, that were traditionally not 8-bit clean.[3] For example, MIME's Base64 implementation uses Aâ€“Z, aâ€“z, and 0â€“9 for the first 62 values. Other variations share this property but differ in the symbols chosen for the last two values; an example is UTF-7.

The earliest instances of this type of encoding were created for dial-up communication between systems running the same OS â€“ for example, uuencode for UNIX and BinHex for the TRS-80 (later adapted for the Macintosh) â€“ and could therefore make more assumptions about what characters were safe to use. For instance, uuencode uses uppercase letters, digits, and many punctuation characters, but no lowercase.[4][5][6][3]
